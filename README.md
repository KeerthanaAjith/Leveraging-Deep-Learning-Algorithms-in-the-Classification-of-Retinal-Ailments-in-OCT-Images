This project explores the use of deep learning algorithms for the classification of retinal ailments using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images. Retinal conditions such as Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) pose significant risks of vision loss. While OCT provides high-resolution images for the diagnosis of these conditions, manual analysis can be slow and prone to errors. This research focuses on automating OCT image classification using state-of-the-art deep learning models, significantly improving diagnostic accuracy and speed.
The project utilizes several prominent convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, including VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, Xception, and MobileNetV2. The novelty of this work lies in integrating a self-attention mechanism within the dense layers of MobileNetV2, which enhances the modelâ€™s ability to recognize critical features and contextual relationships in OCT images.
The MobileNetV2 model with self-attention outperforms other models, achieving 94.3% accuracy in classifying retinal images into categories like Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV), DME, Drusen, and Normal.
Significant improvements in feature recognition and classification performance were observed when self-attention was applied between the second and third dense layers of the model.
Comparative analysis shows that MobileNetV2 with self-attention surpasses other models like VGG16, ResNet50, and DenseNet121, proving that it is both computationally efficient and highly accurate.
This study highlights the potential of deep learning, particularly when enhanced with self-attention mechanisms, in revolutionizing retinal disease diagnostics.
